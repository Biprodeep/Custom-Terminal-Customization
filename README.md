# Custom-Terminal-Customization

Here you see 4 files:--


1. bashrc.txt --> Rename this to--> .bashrc
2. bash_profile.txt --> Rename this to--> .bash_profile
3. MyTerminalTweaks.txt --> Rename this to--> .MyTerminalTweaks
4. pat.sh : This is the output preview file for the design. (Not Required generally but you can use it to preview the changes.) 

[#] Now open the file .MyTerminalTweaks in any text editor and change the name "Biprodeep Roy" to your name and "Vir7u@lGh0s7" to your code name or mask name :) 



[#] Now all you have to do is to copy-paste-replace all the files into your home directory and /etc/skel/ directory.


Have a nice day! All hail OpenSource! :D
